- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @MiselliMartin, an economics teacher currently on the path of learning programming.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in technology, economics, and data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning programming through various channels. I'm studying at two professional formation centers, one focused on databases and OOP, and the other on web design. I'm also part of the Oracle and Alura ONE Program, and I'm on the second stage of the "Argentina Programa", a government initiative where I'm learning data analysis and data science.
